# fullcycle-3.0

> This repo contains all projects, exercises and challenges from the course.

## Repo structure

The repo contains everything related to the Fullcycle 3.0 course. The lessons, challenges and the project itself. So we can consider this a "monorepo" that is structure this way:

- Classrroms folder: Contains exercises and notes related to the lessons.
- Challenges folder: Contains all the challenges from the lessons, it is divided by the Lesson folder and its challenges subfolder. For challenges reviewer I will send the link direct to the challenge folder in the remote repo.
